# ADPP - Application for Children with Special Needs

## Introduction:

-   People with disabilities have the same needs as other people born without disabilities.
    **Those needs are:**
-   Acceptance
-   Understanding
-   Care and protection
-   Love
    What makes them different is the need **FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF SUPPORT**: (wheelchairs, Braille, hearing aids, professional staff at the school-special educators, communicators)

## World Autism Awareness Day (2. april):

-   Our application is dedicated primarily to children with autism, since April 2 is marked as World Autism Awareness Day.
-   On that day, blue balloons are symbolically released around the world, which is the reason why our logo is just like that.
-   In order to create this application, we had to get acquainted with the essence of this problem at a level that is not elementary.

## Introduction to the specifics of people with autism

-   In order to make this application without having its real use purpose, we first had to get acquainted with the specifics of children with elements of autism.

-   **The following is characteristic of them:**
    1.     They adopt best through the social stories expressed in       pictures.
    2.     Slike treba da budu sa što manje detalja i boja jer im to odvlači ionako rasutu pažnju.
    3.     Pictures should be with as little detail and color as possible, because that distracts them from the already scattered attention.
    4.     They have violent reactions to EVERY change of schedule. Routine is important to them.
    5.     Give orders very briefly in a maximum of 2 words: Get up, Get dressed, Brush your teeth, Take your bag, Get on the bus.

This method is called in special education **PECS METOD**.

## Outcomes / objectives of the application:
